# Jupyter Notebooks
Random Experiments and Data Exploration with Jupyter and Python

# More information
This repository contains various data explorations using python and pandas. At some point, I realized that doing my queries directly in SQL is not only risky (what if I accidentally delete everything!), but also can take a good deal of time to work with. Lastly, and probably most importantly, I have no record of what it was that I did, so if I ever needed to do it again... well, I suppose I'm plum out of luck. 

Feel free to look around. There's not much here right now, but perhaps more will be added in the future.
